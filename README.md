pyCloudForce
============
Force your data into the cloud!
(aka let's-hope-this-is-persistent)

Introduction
------------
pyCloudForce is a script that breaks your data into chunks, encrypts them with various techniques and then
puts them into random forms on the internet, looking for permalinks to the content.

If all goes well, you will get a list of URLs containing chunks of your data, ready to be assembled some time later.
